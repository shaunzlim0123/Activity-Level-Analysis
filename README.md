## Introduction

This project offers a detailed analysis of FitBit step data, exploring how effectively people achieve the recommended 150 minutes of moderate activity per week. The notebook delves into data presentation, descriptive statistics, and analytical interpretations, leading to clear conclusions and discussions on limitations.

## Driving Problem

**Question**: "How well do these people meet the recommendation of at least 150 minutes of moderate activity per week?"

We investigated this driving question through a structured analysis of step data, identifying trends, patterns, and key insights.

## Data Analysis

The analysis process included:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and transforming data for analysis.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing the step data to understand general activity trends.
3. **Moderate Activity Calculation**: Estimating weekly active minutes from step counts.
4. **Visualization**: Creating charts to visually represent activity levels and trends.
5. **Hypothesis Testing**: Evaluating if the sample population met the activity recommendations.

## Key Findings

- A significant proportion of participants fell short of the 150-minute weekly target.
- Patterns of activity varied across different days of the week, with weekends showing different step behaviors compared to weekdays.
- Specific demographic factors (e.g., age or occupation) might influence the likelihood of meeting the activity recommendations.

## Conclusions

Our analysis revealed that many participants did not meet the weekly moderate activity target. This highlights potential areas for health interventions or lifestyle adjustments. We also emphasized the importance of consistent physical activity throughout the week.

## Limitations

- **Data Representativeness**: The data may not be fully representative of the general population.
- **Measurement Accuracy**: FitBit step counts can be affected by device wear and user compliance.
- **Assumptions**: Assumptions made during data analysis could introduce biases.
  
## Skills and Tools

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Data Analysis Libraries**: pandas, numpy
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **Statistical Analysis**: Hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics
- **Notebook Environment**: Jupyter
